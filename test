a = """Accordingly, I tried to accumulate as much wealth as humanly possible. It is
true. I tried to acquire as much assistance to communicate my words. Though I
did not pay enough compensation. I was too broke. Consequently, I did not get
much help. People demonstrated to me that I had to discontinue my endeavors.
This would facilitate my life. Oh, life would be much easier. Hence, I
initiated a plan to implement a plan to garner maximum profit. It took some
modifications but nevertheless the objective was completed. I had reached
optimum revenue. Things were going well. I had enough personnel to purchase
and procure as much of the goods as possible. Once they had done what was
necessary, I terminated them. I am trasmitting this document before I die.
Utilize it well.

Please be advised that this document is a test. Without further delay, the
end."""
